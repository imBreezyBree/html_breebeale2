  		<h4>Things you should know about me</h4>
    	<p>I have always found technology massively interesting. My partner is a web designer which sparked my interest with Photoshop initially. I taught myself how to replicate graphics, repair/alter photographs, create fake photos, design logos and banners. All of which was just for fun. I have now taken a keen interest with the development side of websites, I am currently learning the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript plus many more to come, I can honestly say it's becoming my new addition.Most of my working life so far has been based around providing a great customer experience, but most of all I thrive on working with like minded people bouncing off each other constantly helping one another out, whether that would be for problem solving, self-improvement or improving our working life in general.</p>
